# BTHS Symposium 2020 Project - Still Water Battle Demo
WIP read me. Will be finshed in time.  
Demo will be just be a (or multiple) battle(s) based on the battle system for my indie project Still Water.  
Basically a prototype/proof-of-concept.  
Current build in zip file is just a bad overworld demo. Will be updated soon enough, I was just too lazy to figure out how to upload the files at the time of writing this read me, so for now you guys can have the most recent(like a month ago) zip of the project.  
Project was planned to be a bigger demo of the game, to atleast replicate the feeling of the beginning of the game, but it's been diminished into a battle demo.
